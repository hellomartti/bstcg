# .team code generator brawl stars

## /why?
well, recently I saw somewhere how one person takes a team code and changes the value himself in order to get into another random team. this so boring... so I made my own - the automatic way :)

## /how i do that?
I didn’t know how brawl stars generates codes, so I found a [person on Github who explained it all](https://github.com/Gabriel55ita/BrawlDocs). I just took it and remade the code and made it better. also with the help of gpt (I don’t know html :( ), I made a website with which you can easily do all this.

## /how use that?
it's pretty easy. you take the link or code of the above command and paste it into the site, write how many codes you need to generate - and that’s it. You can visit them, with a high chance you will visit a random player :)!

## /how open site?
oh... just press on this - [hellomartti.github.io/bstcg/](https://hellomartti.github.io/bstcg/)
